# LinearRegressionAutoMPG

This project performs regression analysis on the Auto MPG dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The main objective is to predict a carâ€™s fuel efficiency (MPG) based on features such as:
- Number of cylinders
- Horsepower
- Weight
- Engine displacement

We use linear regression as a baseline model to understand how different car attributes affect fuel consumption. Linear regression is ideal for this task as it provides a simple and interpretable way to predict continuous values and assess feature importance through model coefficients.
